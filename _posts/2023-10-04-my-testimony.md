Many people say that I am very lucky to be where I am today. I am grateful for God's blessings in my life. I have been given many unexpected blessings, and His plan is beautiful for my life. This page is dedicated to sharing my testimony with all of you, that God always looks after His children. May this serve as a reminder to all of us. There is no ivory without cracks; let us learn from each other and correct one another.

## 2019: The Year of Hope and Joyful

In 2019, I felt compelled to write my first testimony in a book (softcopy) to share with others. My writing began in June 2019 when I was called to missionary service by God and became rooted in a church. I named this year "the year of hope and joyful" because God brought new hope and joy into my life. I was slowly guided to calm waters and introduced to Him. There are interesting topics you can take from my journey in 2019:

- **June 2019:** I talked about the significant changes in my life within God and how to respond appropriately to the modernization of the world. We know that the world is full of temptations and challenges that increase day by day. It is our perspective that helps us endure in this world.

## 2021: The Year of Praise and Provision

In 2021, I embarked on a journey to comprehend the depths of human existence, finding myself in a year that I'd like to refer to as "The Year of Praise and Provision." This was a time of profound introspection and exploration, where I contemplated the significance of our existence and how we can radiate our light in this vast world.

The year 2021 was not just another passing year; it was a period of profound self-discovery. It was a year where I pondered the grand tapestry of life and our roles within it. I set out to understand the essence of our presence in this world and the remarkable ways in which we impact the world around us.

I firmly believe that every one of us has a unique purpose. It is this purpose that gives meaning to our lives and sets us on a course of fulfillment and contentment. Understanding this purpose and living in alignment with it is the key to making a meaningful difference in the world.

"The Year of Praise and Provision" signifies not only acknowledging our unique purpose but also expressing gratitude for the blessings and opportunities that come our way. It's a year where we not only reflect on what we can achieve but also celebrate the victories, large and small, that shape our lives. Praise becomes a way of life, a constant reminder of the goodness that surrounds us.

As I look back on the past year, I am filled with appreciation for the lessons learned, the challenges faced, and the growth experienced. It's a year that has reinforced the idea that life is a dynamic journey, with each day offering a chance to embrace new opportunities, make a positive impact, and express gratitude for the abundance that life provides.

2021 has been a year of personal growth and self-discovery. It's been a year where I've strived to shine my light and make a positive difference in the world. I've realized that our ability to shine is directly linked to our understanding of our purpose. When we are aligned with our purpose, our actions are infused with passion and authenticity, and our impact on the world is profound.

Moreover, "The Year of Praise and Provision" has taught me the importance of celebrating the present moment. It's easy to get caught up in the pursuit of future goals and aspirations, but it's equally important to acknowledge and celebrate the here and now. Each day is a gift, an opportunity to offer praise and gratitude for the blessings we have in our lives.

As we transition into a new year, the lessons from "The Year of Praise and Provision" remain etched in my heart. I carry with me a deep sense of purpose and an unwavering commitment to live a life that radiates positivity, gratitude, and authentic living. I believe that by embracing our purpose, expressing praise, and being open to the provisions of life, we can create a world that is abundant in love, kindness, and fulfillment.

So, as we step into the future, I invite you to join me on this journey of purpose, praise, and provision. Let's celebrate the uniqueness of our existence and make every day a testament to the blessings that surround us.
