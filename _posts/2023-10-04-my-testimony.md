# Life Testimony

Many people say that I am very lucky to be where I am today. I am grateful for God's blessings in my life. I have been given many unexpected blessings, and His plan is beautiful for my life. This page is dedicated to sharing my testimony with all of you, that God always looks after His children. May this serve as a reminder to all of us. There is no ivory without cracks; let us learn from each other and correct one another.

## 2019: The Year of Hope and Joyful

In 2019, I felt compelled to write my first testimony in a book (softcopy) to share with others. My writing began in June 2019 when I was called to missionary service by God and became rooted in a church. I named this year "the year of hope and joyful" because God brought new hope and joy into my life. I was slowly guided to calm waters and introduced to Him. There are interesting topics you can take from my journey in 2019:

- **June 2019:** I talked about the significant changes in my life within God and how to respond appropriately to the modernization of the world. We know that the world is full of temptations and challenges that increase day by day. It is our perspective that helps us endure in this world.

- **August 2019:** I talked about a message. A message can have many meanings in life, and I myself captured the message that God gave me. In the midst of self-doubt, I found meaning. [Read more](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RACHIFzLPoxhIy4_s4vxyC-U9T7nZPNp)

For those of you looking for a partner, I also discuss it here. [Read more](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_vywQHGEAn5G0Tt4bZB5x4oAozmSde4i)
- **October 2019:** I talked about leadership. Unconsciously, I was pushed to become a leader. Ready or not, there are times when we are pushed to become leaders. [Read more](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mByGfnIFn7eh9Og6QVl7Cc3f48qyxSjF)
- **November 2019:** I talked about love. In fact, the meaning of love has very diverse interpretations. Love God and others, and be different, which I emphasize in this writing. [Read more](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VX4KR2fd5I3kCqc5nn6vPBZ5_fnpJqy_)

## 2020: The Year of Unity and Acceleration

In 2020, I also wrote reflections on strengthening called "The year of Unity and Acceleration." I believe that there is acceleration in God's unity. Let's prepare ourselves to face the extraordinary turmoil happening in this era, especially since there is a tremendous upheaval. Get used to approaching Him.
