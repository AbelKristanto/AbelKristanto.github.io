Hello, my name is [Abel Kristanto Widodo](https://jp.linkedin.com/in/abelkristanto), and I am passionate about the intersection of data science and the financial industry. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering from [Diponegoro University](https://www.undip.ac.id/language/en/home) and have also completed a [Summer Course in Fintech](https://uns.ac.id/en/uns-international-office-held-uns-fintech-summer-course-2020/) from Universitas Sebelas Maret.

I also worked as a Data Consultant at [Innovatz Ltd](http://www.innovatz.com.my/), where I collaborated with financial institutions (for example PT Pegadaian, where I focused on developing retail credit solutions) to provide data-driven insights and strategies. This experience honed my ability to translate complex data into actionable recommendations, enabling companies to optimize their operations and achieve their business objectives.

Currently, I am excited to share my knowledge and expertise as a Mentor in Data Science. I am committed to guiding aspiring data scientists and professionals who wish to embark on a similar path in the financial industry. By mentoring, I aim to inspire and empower individuals to leverage data science techniques and tools to drive innovation and success in the financial sector.

I firmly believe that data science has the power to revolutionize the financial industry by uncovering valuable insights, improving risk management, and enhancing customer experiences. If you share my passion for data science in the financial sector, I would be thrilled to connect and explore potential collaborations or discuss opportunities for growth and innovation.

Thank you for taking the time to learn about my journey, and I look forward to connecting with you soon!
